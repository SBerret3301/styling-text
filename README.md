1. **Document Metadata:** Meta tags provide information about the HTML document. The `charset` specifies the character encoding, and the `viewport` sets the initial scale for responsive design.

2. **Bootstrap CSS Link:** The `<link>` tag is used to include the Bootstrap CSS file, which provides styling for the document.

3. **Title:** The title of the document is changed to "Text Styling Examples."

4. **Containers and Headings:** Divided the content into different containers with headings to organize and explain each set of examples.

5. **Text Styling Examples:** Demonstrations of different text alignments, text decoration, text transformations, and list styling using Bootstrap classes.
